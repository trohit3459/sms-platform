# SMS Platform Demo Project

This project is a miniature simulation of a real-world, asynchronous SMS delivery platform. It demonstrates a microservices-style architecture using Spring Boot, Apache Kafka for message queuing, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

The core functionality involves receiving an SMS request from a customer, processing it asynchronously, and simulating the final delivery to a telecom operator.
